❓Here are some *questions I would love to get insights on*  (see the description for the context and the motivation):

[Q1] What is the best way to *lift the head* for sighting?
• Should I *press more* with my extended arm, or rely on *arching my neck* (and my back)?

[Q2] How can I *avoid injuries* ?
• I already have neck and back issues - how can I *sight without strain* ?

[Q3] How do I *maintain good body position* while sighting?
• I feel my *hips drop* when I lift my head up.

[Q4] How do I keep an *effective catch & pull* while sighting?
• Pressing down on the water _(vertically)_ for sighting seems to *waste one stroke* to me: I cannot properly push the water towards my feet _(horizontally)_ for propulsion.
• Is there a better way?

[Q5] *How much* should sighting *slow me down* ? ⭐
• If I swim 400m in the pool without sighting at 1'30/100m, what is an *acceptable pace loss* when *sighting every 6 strokes* ?
• At what point (e.g., 1'32, 1'35, 1'40/100m) does the slowdown *indicate inefficient sighting technique* rather than just the natural cost of looking forward?

[Q6] *Which stroke rate* should I aim for as an *amateur* ?
• It seems to depend on the *water conditions* and the morphology (tall athletes tend to have lower stroke rates?).
• Pros generally seem to swim at 70-95 strokes per minute (SPM), but *should amateurs try to match this* , let's say on a 1500m course?

[Q7] How can I *increase my stroke rate* without losing efficiency? What *trade-offs* are acceptable?
• Should I *exit my arms earlier* , *glide less* , or *catch less water* ?
• Should I increase *pull speed* ? I already find it difficult to push the water - does this mean I need *more strength* ?
• Elite swimmers do not seem to *fully extend their gliding arm* - why?

[Q8] Should my head be *fully submerged* between strokes?
• I was taught to aim for *full immersion* in pool swimming.
• Going low through chops sounds beneficial in OWS too, as it reduces *wave resistance* .
• However, many elite triathletes keep part of their *head out* - is it because they *sight often* ?
• Should I still *prioritize full immersion* , especially outside sighting strokes?

[Q9] I have also learnt to turn around buoys using the "backstroke" technique.
• E.g. https://youtu.be/RqDT16YewrA
• But pros do not seem to use that at all.

I hope that coaches will re-use this video to *analyse, explain and illustrate* key concepts of *open-water swimming techniques* for *amateur triathletes* .
