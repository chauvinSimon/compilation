---

This is one of the questions I have explored by analysing *over 15 years* of race data from nearly *500 elite races* , leveraging the World Triathlon API.

The research delves into a *variety of topics* , including:
• 👟 Are runs faster since the introduction of carbon-plate shoes?
• 🐧 Should weaker swimmers rejoice when wetsuits are allowed?
• 🚿 How much time does a wetsuit add to T1?
• 👫 How much faster are men compared to women, and in which sport is the gap larger or smaller?
• 🌡️ Do air and water temperatures influence performance?

👉 One of the goals: To encourage a shift towards *data-driven research* that reflects *real race conditions* - offering more relevant insights than small lab-based studies.

💻 The *full report* is available at ⏩ https://github.com/chauvinSimon/tri_stats ⏪. While dense, the findings are split into sections for easier reading. There is also a *takeaway section* at the end for a concise summary.

❗ Acknowledgement: This work done in my free time is *far from perfect* - I welcome constructive feedback! Statistical significance tests, for example, are in most cases not included.

💬 Have *question, insights, or ideas* ? I would love to hear your thoughts.
