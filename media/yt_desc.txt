🏊 How Elite Triathletes Swim - A 2024 Compilation 🏊
https://youtu.be/gCwEpkmkF-o

---

This compilation is intended for coaches to *create educational video analyses* of *swimming techniques* specific to *open-water swimming* and *triathlon* racing. ⬇️⬇️⬇️

# 🎬 What is Included?

The *compilation* consists of many short video clips showcasing *elite* male and female *triathletes* swimming in *real race* conditions.

- 🎥 Various *camera angles* for detailed technique breakdown.
- 🌊 Diverse *water conditions* : from calm lakes to rough, choppy seas.
- 📏 Multiple *race distances* : 300m, 750m, 1500m, 2000m and 3800m.
- 🩱 Different *swim gears* : swimskins, tri-suits, and wetsuits.
- 🏁 Different *swim phases* covered: start, middle, and end of the race (excluding sprint starts).

# ⚠️ Limitations

- No *underwater footage* : the catch and pull phases are not clearly visible.
- Footage primarily focuses on *race leaders* , who often swim in *relatively calm water* .
  - This may not reflect the experience of amateur triathletes, who typically race in *crowded packs* with more drafting and physical contact.
- *Elite* athletes may use different techniques than *amateur triathletes* (e.g., higher stroke rates).
  - However, many aspects - such as sighting, breathing and body position - remain *valuable for all swimmers* .

# 🤷 Motivation

I have learned a lot from existing resources explaining *swimming techniques* , such as  @PierreCoachingNatation  👏.

However, most of them focus on *pool swimming* rather than *open-water* racing.

My *goal* is to understand two things:
- 1️⃣ What makes *open-water swimming* (OWS) in triathlon different from *pool swimming* ?
- 2️⃣ How to *transfer skills from the pool* to real OWS race conditions?

# 🔍 Key Open-Water Swimming Insights

I list below what I *have read and understood* from swim coaches.

# Main specificities of OWS
- *Sighting:* Sight first and then breathe
- *Drafting:* Either on the toes or on the hip

# Main OWS differences - compared to pool
- *Stroke rate:* Increased - but without sacrificing technique
- *Hand recovery:* Higher and wider
- *Hand entry:* More assertive
- *Breathing:* Slightly higher head position to account for waves
- *Stroke exit:* Slightly earlier to maintain a higher cadence

# Other OWS tips
- *Sight:* Every 6 to 12 strokes in straight line for navigation
- *Sight:* Quick: take a snapshot
- *Sight:* Not too high: crocodile eyes if possible, depending on the waves
- *Sight:* Time it with wave patterns (ideally at wave peaks)
- *Sight:* Look for tall landmarks
- *Sight:* Done via two movements:
  - Press on the water with the extended arm
  - Lift the head (and arch the back slightly)
- *Neck:* Return the head to a neutral, relaxed position after sighting
- *Head:* Keep the neck straight and the head looking down, to keep a straight line
- *Breath:* Example: 2-2-2-3 pattern to alternate breathing side
- *Breath:* Always keep a little extra air left
- *Style:* Asymmetrical: longer glide on one side, shorter on the other ("galloping stroke"?)
- *Kick:* Use a stronger kick just after sighting to maintain speed
- *Effort:* Accelerate after being slowed down by a wave
- *Effort:* Even or negative split
- Keep calm :innocent:

## 🔭 Some of My Observations of Elite Triathletes

- Breathing: Mostly *every 2 strokes*.
- Sighting: Very frequent!
  - Every *4, 6 or 8 strokes* on *straight sections*.
    - Surprising to me: Even athletes drafting on toes *sight as often as leaders* .
  - Every 2 strokes around buoys.
- Stroke Rate:
  - Ranges *70-95 SPM*, averaging around 80-90 SPM.
  - Varies by race distance and swim style.
- Body Position: Head not fully submerged between strokes.
- Kick Pattern: Diverse.

# 👋 Next steps

I hope this video helps swimmers and coaches better understand open-water swimming (OWS) techniques.

In particular, *experts and coaches* can *use this compilation* to explain and illustrate key *concepts of OWS* , hopefully also sharing their analysis online.

Thanks for reading/watching, and happy swimming! 🏊
Cheers,
Simon 😃
